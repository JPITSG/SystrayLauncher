# SystrayLauncher

A lightweight Windows system tray application that hosts a WebView2 browser window. Designed for web apps that you want quick access to without cluttering your taskbar.

## Features

- **System Tray Integration** - Runs in the system tray; double-click to open, close/minimize to hide
- **WebView2 Browser** - Uses Microsoft Edge WebView2 for modern web compatibility
- **Configurable** - Set custom URL, window title, and JavaScript hooks via GUI
- **JavaScript Hooks** - Execute custom JavaScript when the window is shown or hidden (useful for pausing/resuming web app activity)
- **Registry Storage** - Settings persist in Windows Registry (`HKCU\SOFTWARE\JPIT\SystrayLauncher`)
- **Single Instance** - Only one instance can run at a time
- **First-Launch Setup** - Configuration dialog appears automatically on first run

## Context Menu Options

Right-click the tray icon to access:

- **WebView2 Version** - Displays the current WebView2 runtime version
- **Refresh** - Reloads the page and brings window to foreground
- **Refresh + Clear Cache** - Clears browser cache and reloads
- **Open** - Shows the main window
- **Configure** - Opens the settings dialog
- **Exit** - Closes the application

## Configuration

Settings available in the Configure dialog:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Window Title | Title shown in the window title bar |
| URL | The web page to load |
| JavaScript on Hide | JS executed when window is fully covered or hidden |
| JavaScript on Show | JS executed when window becomes visible |

## Icon Customization

The application uses a single icon file (`icon.ico`) that appears in multiple locations:

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| System Tray | Small icon in the notification area (16x16 or 32x32 depending on DPI) |
| Window Title Bar | Icon shown in the top-left corner of the main window |
| Taskbar | Icon displayed when the window is visible |
| Alt-Tab Switcher | Icon shown when cycling through windows |

### Replacing the Icon

1. Replace `icon.svg` with your own SVG file
2. Run `make icon` to generate `icon.ico` (requires ImageMagick)
3. Rebuild with `make`

This generates a multi-resolution `.ico` containing 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 sizes, covering all DPI scaling levels. The icon is embedded into the executable at compile time via `resource.rc`.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) (usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11)

## Building from Source

Requires MinGW-w64 cross-compiler and the WebView2 SDK.

```bash
# Download WebView2 SDK (one-time)
make deps

# Build
make

# Output: SystrayLauncher.exe + WebView2Loader.dll in release/
```
